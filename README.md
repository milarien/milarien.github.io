## Epistemic Governance & Deterministic AI Architecture

I design governance infrastructure for large language models deployed in regulated environments.

My work focuses on epistemic admissibility, constraint-forced collapse, and deterministic audit-layer reasoning — addressing the structural failure mode of premature ambiguity resolution in modern LLM systems.

## Current Research

### Epistemic Legitimacy as a Governance Layer for Large Language Models (2026)

Transport-layer governance architecture that:

- Maintains parallel admissible interpretations
- Enforces constraint-based collapse
- Treats refusal as a correct outcome
- Produces a tamper-evident forensic audit trail
- Operates provider-agnostically across LLM vendors

## Core Concepts

**Parallel Epistemic Field (PEF)**
Non-temporal persistence of admissible interpretations.

**Admissibility Gating**
Interpretive commitments must pass structural constraints.

**Constraint-Forced Collapse Only**
No probabilistic or heuristic resolution of ambiguity.

**Deterministic Governance Spine**
Every decision is reproducible and auditable.

The objective is not improved fluency.
**The objective is structural legitimacy.**
